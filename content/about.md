Hello, I'm Hantian James Zhao. I'm a Embedded/Firmware Software Engineer. I have spend most of my career writing software that runs on embedded hardwares.
I am Canadian-Chinese, complete fluent in English, conversational in Chinese, and barely survivable French and Japanese.
My current home is Somerville, Massachusetts.
