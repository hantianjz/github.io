I've experimented with several LLM-based coding assistants over the past few months, and my journey has been both enlightening and challenging. Initially, I tried avante.nvim, but its ergonomics left much to be desired. I then moved on to CodeCompanion, which, while promising, made it difficult to integrate specific contexts or buffers into the LLM. My experience with Aider has been a bit more positive; it functions more like a dedicated coder agent and can operate across an entire repository. Its ability to automatically detect buffers and offer auto-completion for terms and symbols is a welcome improvement. However, I've encountered a few problematic instances where Aider unexpectedly deleted an entire code file, preserving only the section I explicitly requested. This issue is concerning, and I plan to investigate whether there are any specific cursor rules that might address this behavior. At the moment, Cursor stands out as the best LLM IDE in my workflow, primarily due to its superior context management and its ability to precisely interpret the requests I make within a file.

In reflecting on my approach, I suspect that I may not be using these LLM coding tools as effectively as I could. Often, I find myself micromanaging the agent by dictating every minute detail, rather than providing a broader outline of the desired outcome. This over-specification not only stifles the creative potential of the LLM but also adds unnecessary complexity to the coding process. I believe that by stepping back and offering a more general idea, I can allow the agent to leverage its strengths and deliver more innovative solutions. Embracing this higher-level approach might ultimately lead to a more fluid and efficient coding experience.

More recently, I have been focusing on Yocto projects—a realm notorious for its complexity. Despite comprehensive documentation, deciphering the detailed syntax and workflow nuances remains a significant challenge. To overcome this, I turned to NotebookLLM from Google, which has proven to be an invaluable resource. By uploading the entire Yocto project documentation as a single PDF, I was able to tap into NotebookLLM’s vast contextual capacity. The tool allowed me to ask targeted questions and receive detailed answers, complete with specific references to the documentation. This approach has transformed how I learn new subjects, making the process more intuitive and effective. Additionally, the podcast overview provided alongside the documentation offered further insights, enriching my overall understanding of Yocto and its intricacies.
